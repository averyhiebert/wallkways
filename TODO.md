# REDUCED SCOPE PLAN
(a.k.a. "how do I salvage my overscoped jam idea")

- 3D puzzle levels composed primarily of scaffold/walkways
    - add checkpoints here and there around the place.
        - burning oil drums?
    - no defined "up" direction.
        - justifiable, as a) this is necessary for tutorialization, and b) these are in-universe constructed to "investigate the gravitational aberration."
- add 3 or 4 small "destination" scenes that can be interesting, but SMALL.
    - these can be easy to access "upright" but have some amound of puzzle to access the actual "goal" via an alternate angle.
- Goal is to "activate all three emergency switches", at which point the gravitational anomaly will deactivate (and you fall straight up or something, brave sacrifice etc.)

# STORY
- Goal: fix all antennas & then activate server with orientation code 0,1,0
- Twist: There are upside-down messages insisting "correct" orientation is 0,-1,0.  Must choose correctly.
    - Main buildings are "upright" according to management, informal encampments are "upright" according to the union?
- Language: labour & management couldn't "agree on a unified direction for the project"

# Features needed for playtesting:
- in-game menu minimum:
    - mouse sensitivity, invert x/y, FOV
    - Fullscreen?
- proper display of signs and computer
- computer part of story.
- can only checkpoint while upright?

# Features needed before release:
- Text-only mode for intro/outro?
- main menu/credits
- UI styling
- music
- visual polish
    - particles on repaired antennas
    - flames on checkpoints?

# Nice-to-have
- fullscreen button?
- nicer lighting?
- basic audio cues
    - antenna repair
    - death
    - checkpoint
- more visual polish

# Trailer/screenshot ideas:
- upside-down under walled area, looking towards main level.
- upright looking at tower
- something with text on screen. 
- looking at sparking antenna?
